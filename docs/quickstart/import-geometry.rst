Importing Geometry
==================

To import an image of the compartments in the model, go to `Import->Geometry from image`.

The image should be segmented such that each compartment has a unique colour.

For each compartment in the model:

- click on the compartment name
- click on "Select compartment geometry..."
- then click on the desired part of the image.
