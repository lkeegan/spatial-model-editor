Command Line Interface
======================

A (currently very minimal) Command Line Interface (CLI) is also provided.

Precompiled binaries for linux/macOS/windows can be downloaded from https://github.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/releases

It can currently be used to simulate an existing model and save the resulting images. Run `./spatial-cli --help` for more details.
