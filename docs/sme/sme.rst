A Python interface ``sme`` is available, which can be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/sme/>`_ with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sme

.. note::

    If your python version or platform is not supported, please submit a `feature request <https://github.com/spatial-model-editor/spatial-model-editor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=add%20support%20for%20new%20Python%20platform>`_

To get started, take a look at the :ref:`example-notebooks`, or the :ref:`api-reference`.

.. tip ::

    There is an online `colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/spatial-model-editor/spatial-model-editor/blob/master/docs/sme/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb>`_ where you can try it out in your browser without installing anything on your computer.
