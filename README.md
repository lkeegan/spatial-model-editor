A GUI editor to convert non-spatial SBML models of bio-chemical reactions
into 2d spatial models and simulate them using the
[dune-copasi](https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi) solver
for reaction-diffusion systems.

To get started, download and run the GUI for your operating system

- [![linux](docs/quickstart/img/icon-linux.png) linux](../../releases/latest/download/spatial-model-editor)
- [![macOS](docs/quickstart/img/icon-osx.png) macOS](../../releases/latest/download/spatial-model-editor.dmg)
- [![linux](docs/quickstart/img/icon-windows.png) windows](../../releases/latest/download/spatial-model-editor.exe)

Or take a look at the [documentation](https://spatial-model-editor.readthedocs.io/)

## Project status

### [WP1a](https://github.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/projects/1)

Allow the user to describe a spatial model:

- import/export SBML
- add geometry
- diffusion coefficients
- spatially varying initial concentrations
- etc.

### [WP1b](https://github.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/projects/2)

Translate the spatial model to a system of PDEs and simulate it:

- generate 2d triangular mesh
- construct PDEs and Jacobians
- simulate using DUNE
- visualize simulation results, etc.
