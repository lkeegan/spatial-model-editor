Last entry in table 3 of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0146664X82900570?via%3Dihub gives

`L = 0.98 n + 0.426 m - 0.091 n_c`

where
- `n` is the number of steps between pixels
- `m` is the number of these that are diagonal
- `n_c` is the number of corners: the number of times the direction of the step changes

One option would be to use this to calculate a single rescaling factor `L/M` for each membrane, where `M` is the number of pixel edges in the membrane, such that the effective total length of the membrane is approx correct.

This is for 8-connected pixels, which is what our pixel contours are.

However, our membrane is really the edges of thes pixels, not the centres, so we could instead use their 4-connected formula with the pixel corner contour:

`L = 0.948 n - 0.278 n_c`
We could also use a 4-connected formula with our pixel-corner contour instead
