Running a Simulation
====================

To simulate the spatial model, click on the "Simulate" tab, specify the simulation time and the integration time step, then click "Simulate"

The resulting average species concentrations are plotted as a function of time. A snapshot of the spatial distribution is shown on the left, and the slider below the image can be used to change the time that is being displayed.
