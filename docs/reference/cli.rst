Command Line Interface
======================

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is also provided for running long simulations.

Precompiled binaries for linux/macOS/windows can be downloaded from https://github.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/releases

It can currently be used to simulate an existing model and save the resulting images. Run

.. code-block:: bash

    ./spatial-cli --help

for more details.
