# Documentation [![documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spatial-model-editor/badge/)](https://spatial-model-editor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

- user documentation is written in [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) format

- `sme` API documentation is generated from the [Google style Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html#example-google)

- documentation should be updated along with source code changes in pull requests

## Read the Docs

- on each commit, docs are automatically compiled and uploaded to [readthedocs](https://spatial-model-editor.readthedocs.io/)

- note: `sme` API documentation is generated by readthedocs from the `sme` module using `pip install sme`

  - this avoids having to compile sme on readthedocs

  - however it means the documentation is generated from the latest PyPI version, not the code in the commit

  - the readthedocs build can be manually ran again after a new PyPI version is uploaded to update the docs

- open pull requests are also compiled and can be previewed on readthedocs

## Animated screenshots

- the quickstart guide contains animated screenshots in `apng` format

- [peek.sh](peek.sh) is a simple script to help record these using [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) (on linux)
