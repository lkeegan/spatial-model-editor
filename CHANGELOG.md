## [1.0.6] - 2021-01-29
### Added
- python library `sme.Model.simulate`:
  - simulation results now also contain rate of change of concentrations
  - option to return partial results instead of throwing on simulation timeout

### Changed
- more accurate initial concentration interpolation for dune-copasi simulations
  - applies to both GUI simulations and exported TIFF files for stand-alone dune-copasi simulation
- improved performance of interior point determination in mesh construction

### Fixed
- meshing bug where invalid 2-point boundary line could cause crash

## [1.0.5] - 2021-01-02
### Added
- user can edit dune-copasi Newton solver parameters
- Pixel simulator supports reactions that explicitly depend on t, x, y

### Changed
- dune-copasi simulations now support membrane flux terms
  - rectangular membrane compartments no longer required
  - simpler mesh generation
