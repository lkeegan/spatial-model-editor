Importing Geometry
==================

After importing a model, the next step is to import an image of the compartments in the model. To do this, go to `Import->Geometry from image`, or choose one of the built-in example images from `Import->Example geometry image`.

The image should be segmented such that each compartment has a unique colour.

For each compartment in the model:

- click on the compartment name
- click on "Select compartment geometry..."
- then click on the desired part of the image.
