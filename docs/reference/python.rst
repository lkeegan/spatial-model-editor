Python Interface
================

A Python interface is available, which can be installed with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sme

.. Note::

    CPython 3.5+ is supported on 64-bit linux, macOS(10.14+), and windows. If you would like support for another platform or Python version/implementation to be added, please file an `issue <https://github.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/issues/new>`

Once it is installed, you should be able to import the module

.. code-block:: python

    $ python
